	  		<br><p>Established in 2013, DawgTalk has led a revolution in the way you communicate with your dearly beloved. Our exceptional collars and compatible mobile app translates your dog's barks into English words and phrases.</p>
	  		
	  		<br><p>The science is simple. We took it upon ourselves to analyze thousands of recorded barks, testing each clip for its: frequency, duration, and interval per bark. Our findings ledus to dividing the sampled yelps into two different categories. Angry or disturbed barks resulted in harsh, low-frequency recordings, whereas happy or playful barks gave a high-frequency outcome.</p>

	  		<br><p>With this knowledge, we have programmed our collar into recording your dog's bark, mapping its data, find a similar match, and the results are sent to your smartphone device when the accompanied DawgTalk application is open. The English translation is heard through the app, or can be read on the screen.</p>
