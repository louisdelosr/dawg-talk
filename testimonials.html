		 	 	<p>I never understood why Sugar Cube didn't like it when I took her to the beach, but with DawgTalk, she told me it's because she didn't like the sand between her toes! Now she wears little booties, pink to match her collar. Super cute!! <strong><br>-- Candy, from San Francisco, CA, USA</strong></p>

		 	 	<p>I'm glad I signed up with the Community, I have met some great people on there! We meet up for play dates at a local dog park, and it's a lot more fun being there with people you can crack jokes with. Thanks DawgTalk!<strong> <br>-- Terry, from Kingston, ON, CAN</strong></p>

		 	<div id="profileContent2">
		 	 	<p>I was really worried about Ty's whimpering. She would hide herself away under the couch and bark quietly to herself. I'd never seen her behave like this before. I bought DawgTalk to help with the communication barrier, turns out, she was pregnant! <br><br> We found suitable homes for the puppies through the online Community. DawgTalk has helped us an enormous amount! Definitely the greatest purchase I've ever made for Ty and I. <strong><br>-- Mel, from Charlottetown, PEI, CAN</strong></p>
